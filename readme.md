## About this version

### Two new options

I splitted the "pin visor" menu action into two separate actions:

* Auto Hide
* Always on Top

These options are both available in the visor menu AND the preference pane. The preference pane sets the behavior you want *by default* and the visor menu lets you override it until the application is closed. Changing them from the visor menu won't change the preference pane settings.

### New tab bugfix

This version contains a fix for visor issue #73: creating a new tab while visor is hidden make visor being "stuck".
